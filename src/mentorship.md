# Mentorship

Finding mentors in your work and regular life is super important.

Recently I had the pleasure of being in a coffee chat with the Director of my division at #Microsoft. He gave a great breakdown of how to seek mentorship in your career, so I thought I’d summarize and share.
There’s two types of mentors you should be looking out for, technical mentors and career mentors.

First there’s technical mentors.
When it comes to technical skills and your work, these are people you can reach out to easily, who answer your questions and entertain your curiosity.
These are the people that’ll go out of their way to make sure you’re not only learning, but make you feel like you’re involved in what’s going on.

You also have you career mentors.
These are the people you can be open with about everything going right and wrong in life. You can share how you feel, how you like your job or team, and what could possibly improve.
And they listen, give great advice, and help you figure out where you want to be and how to get there.

At the end of the day, finding good mentors is about finding others who inspire you, get you connected, and push you to become your best self.
