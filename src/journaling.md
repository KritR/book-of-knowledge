# Journaling

## Why journal ?

I first started journaling after reading some random internet articles.
I was told it would be good for productivity and self reflection.
Did this happen? Not entirely haha.

But it did serve as good for balance. Eventually I started using journaling as a way to balance out my life. Everytime I felt anything out of usual, like stress, sadness, or happiness beyond the usual bounds, I would record it in my journal. This way I could always note the way I'm thinking.

What I've found is that writing forces me to think through my thoughts. To actually concretetize what I'm feeling.
By working with my thoughts and feelings as words, I felt like I also gain a sense of power over them.
This also gives me an easier way to identify the root causes to my feelings, and analyze trends and cycles of thoughts and emotions over time.

By understanding these ideas better, I'm better able to prepare for the future and modify my mindset towards life :)

## Ideas for journaling

These are all things I have noted in my journal:

- 5 things I appreciate
- Positive impacts I've had
- How I'm feeling in the moment
- Things I was looking forward to tomorrow
- New goals for myself
- Going with the flow of writing :)
