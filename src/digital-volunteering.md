# Digital Volunteering

There's a lot of ways to contribute to the global community in relatively simple ways. Many of these are unheard of and I figured I should include this section to make sure people are aware of these programs.

- [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org) - Contribute to meaningful datasets and researh projects.
- [Missing Maps](https://www.missingmaps.org) - Help fix the lack of maps in places where we need maps. The red cross uses this to provide valuable aid during disasters.
- [All of Us](https://www.joinallofus.org) - Sign up to donate your genome for research
- [Folding at Home](https://foldingathome.org) - Donate compute power to folding proteins and finding cures to new diseases.
