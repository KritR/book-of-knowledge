# Lifestyle

While going through life what I've decided is this.
Regardless of the situation I'm in, or what I'm prioritizing. Or who I am. Life is always going to be about finding some sort of a balance between things. Recently, I've found the following things to be most important for me to continue doing, in order to maintain balance.

- Sleep Well
- Exercise
- Meditate
- Do Yoga
- Eating Well
- Self Check In / Journal
- Have Meaningful Work
- Organizing thoughts / things around me
  - Keeping a Todo List
  - Adding things to my calendar

Keeping these things going will allow me to wake up the next morning, feeling like I can tackle whatever's coming ahead of me. Even if everything gets overboard, stresswise, work wise, relationship wise. I know that at the end of the day, if I maintain these things, with time, my life should go back to normal and I will be healthily functioning.
