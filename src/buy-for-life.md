# BUY IT FOR LIFE

So this is based off of reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife. Totally worth checking out if you haven't already.
These are products that you could purchase once, and have it last for a lifetime.
Some of these are lies.

Here's what’s worth looking @ on this list:

- Cables
- Blanket

## CookingWare

- Le Creuset
