# Job Hunting

Now that you've taken care of your end of things, you can ask the world for some money.

## Determining your ideal position

This is ultimately one of the most important things to career satisfaction.
Here are a few questions that could help.

- What defines a meaningful career?
  - Does the work you do need to have a greater impact ?
- What magnitude of compensation is required to keep you around ?
- What sort of team are you looking for?
- Is this a highly social environment or one where you're more left to your own devices?
- What sort of time and mental commitment are you comfortable putting in?
- How long do you plan on staying in a role ?
- What sort of growth opportunities should this career provide, both laterally (same role different areas) and vertically (promotions and different roles) ?

## Determining avenues to seek jobs

- College Campus Events
- Career Fairs
- Online Job Boards
- LinkedIn
- Recruiter Connections
- Friends and Acquaintances

## Narrowing Down Target Roles

Once you've scoured the internet a little bit, or before a big career event. Make sure you make lists of the roles and companies you're interested in. Talking to every company in the room or applying to every application probably isn't worth the time.

A lot of times, career fairs especially don't give you a lot of time to work. Long lines, talking to people for long durations, spending hours on initial applications and unnecessary quizzes people send out is the norm. As such, only shoot for what you need, don't waste your time that could probably be better spent in other ways.

## Talking to Recruiters

Before you even talking to a recruiter, be prepared with a little bit of information about a company. This generally happens at company events or career fairs so I assume you know in advance who you'll be talking to. Do some research, figure out where you could potentially be of help, check out their roles online.

Once you're there, you're gonna have to pull out the social guns. All smiles from here. Feel confident, have a resume ready to hand, and a hand ready to shake.
Generally at this point, depending on how you're feeling, you start off with the 3-5 minute speech. This is to paint a good picture of who you are, and the recruiter will be given a moment to get a head start on reading your resume.

After that point it's a normal conversation, take it how it goes, have some fun, the recruiters a person after all, and they probably won't bite. I landed an interview once because the recruiter just wanted to complain about the company and I was there to empathize. It's an interesting world out there, so don't forget, you're talking to fellow humans.
