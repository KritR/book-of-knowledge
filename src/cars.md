# Cars

This is what initially prompted me to create this repo.

## Inner workings of a Car

This playlist outlines quite a few topics.
Eventually I'll build this out.

## Buying Cars

4 Things to Pay Attention To

In order :)

1. Trade in

Don't say you have a trade in right off the bat. This immediately gives sales people a way to quote you a lower overall price. This is a common negotiation tactic to make a higher priced car seem much more reasonable. Nothing wrong with it, it's just you don't want to put yourself at a disadvantage in the beginning.

2. Price

This is where you want to negotiate. If you can negotiate the price, you should be set. This is where people are generally less willing to budge, but you should focus on this point. The absolute value of the car. The down payment and monthly payment are irrelevant ish.

3. Down Payment

You can tweak this as you'd like

4. Monthly Payment

This is where the most money will be made off you. Interest rates quoted by dealerships are high and since the total price is more obfuscated this way, it's harder to get what you want.
Therefore, bring in your own financing, don't announce it immediately, but make it happen.
