# Interesting Purchases

This is a list of my latest and most interesting purchase considerations.
If it doesn't have a price or review, it's because I haven't bought it.

- Metal Comb (\$7)

Totally worth. Doesn't get lost. Looks nice. Rings in your hair.

- Weighted Blanket (\$50)

Worth if you care about your sleep. Everyone should get one because it's like a full body cuddle. And everyone needs that.

- Honey Sticks (\$?)

These make really interesting snacking items. They're just novel. I don't even know what else to say about it.

- Bidet (\$?)

You know you need one. C'mon.

- Squatty Potty (\$?)

I'm pretty sure this is literally better for your bathroom experience. Even unicorns use it.

- Cube Printer (\$?)

I'm not sure how I feel about this. But being able to print labels literally anywhere sounds handy.
